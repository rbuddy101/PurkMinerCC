1. Open the .bat file provided. Use the high difficulty port if you are using a mining rig.
2. Input your wallet address and desired pool/ scatchpad download link and save the file ***DEFAULT POOL IS PURK.OMINOUSNETWORK.COM***
3. To Prevent crashes open the "Prevent Crashes" folder and activate "Disable program not responding" This will close the message when miner crashes and will let it fully restart.
4. Once you have done these steps you are good to launch the .bat file and begin mining. 

OVERCLOCK FOR 10 SERIES NVIDIA CARDS

100% power
+100 core
+450-600 memory any number in this range will function fine. Higher may give mroe low difficulty shares but will most likely not result in you getting temp banned from a pool

FOR 1080, 1080ti and TITAN USERS open the Boost hash folder and launch the .xe in there and have it running while mining to increase hash power. In addition feel free donate to the OhGodACompany to thank them for their hard work.
